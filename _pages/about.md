Welcome to Anonyville. My name is Mitchell and I am a Data Engineer and privacy professional based in Sydney Australia.

I work as a Data & Privacy Engineer at ubank. I've worked in a number of industries with start ups and scale ups and have 
spent much of my career building highly available, distributed data systems.

I am passionate about data privacy and privacy engineering and applying them to data science and software engineering projects.
